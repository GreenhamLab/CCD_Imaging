The script requires Python 3. There are no other dependencies. Simply drop the .py file
anywhere convenient.

# RUNNING #
###########

Run the script using Python 3, and provide it a start time (i.e. the time of the first acquisition)
interval between lights-off periods, duration of the lights-off, and intensity of the lights in
the 0-1000 scale used by the Heliospectra software. Note that this script will always set the
5700K white lights to be off since they phosphoresce considerably.

All times are in 24-hour local time. So, if an imaging experiment was run in constant light set
to 150, with images being taken every two hours starting at 1:00 AM, and the lights-off period being
seven minutes, the invocation would be

python3 helioscheduler.py 01:00:00 02:00:00 00:05:00 150

The script will then generate schedule.txt in the directory the script was run from. This can
be loaded into the Heliospectra web interface directly.

This script is not capable of generating a schedule for an LD imaging experiment since it does
not have options for an extended dark period. However, this can be easily achieved by removing
the appropriate entries from the schedule in the Heliospectra web interface.
